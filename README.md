This repository extends and unifies analytical pipelines that contributed to the 
work reported in:

**Vanbergen S., Deschepper P., Van Autreve J., Huyshauwer V., Virgilio M., Bonte J., Dermauw W. (2026).**  
*Genomic tracing reveals multiple independent occurrences of Bactrocera dorsalis in Belgium.*  
**Insects**.

The repositories containing the pipelines that generated the published results can be found in:

## PESTFLY consolidated workflow

This repository provides a unified and application-oriented continuation of the 
analytical workflows above, integrating their contributions into a practical 
diagnostic and operational tool for SNP- and COI-based origin tracing.

*The workflow is under active development. Elements will be made publicly available 
in stages as they become validated, consolidated, and fully documented.*
